About Ray-Ban Caribbean
First released in the Golden Age of air travel, Caribbean sunglasses deliver authentic jet-set style. This 1960s model from our design archive is a subtle departure from the Original Wayfarer and a comfortable all-day wear. A bar rivet instead of the familiar dot distinguishes the new release from its predecessor. Available with the Legend Gold lens logo, straight from the archive.
