About Bloom
Bloom shows off a retro-inspired square shape, but boasts an eco-friendly construction of bio-acetate — an earth-conscious material that’s both biodegradable and made from a renewable source. The soft shade of translucent yellow makes for a look that’s both subtle and sophisticated, a perfect addition to our premium in-house eyewear brand, RFLKT.
