About Ozone
Don’t let this retro-inspired style fool you, because this frame couldn’t be more modern. Ozone boasts an eco-friendly construction of bio-acetate — an earth-conscious material that’s both biodegradable and made from a renewable source. Shown in translucent dark green, perfect for those looking for a “greener” frame in both form and function.
